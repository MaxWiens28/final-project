      <h3>My Upbringing</h3>
      <p>Hi, my name is Max Wiens. For my entire life, I have lived on a small farm just outside of Winnipeg. I live there with my parents, my two brothers, and our dog Yukon. I grew up in a very loving household. But with living on a farm it was quickly instilled upon me that nothing in life comes for free, everything that I have in my life I have worked for and earned.</p>   
      <h3>Why I went into Software Development</h3>
      <p> From a very young age, I was fascinated with technology primarily with video games. I was amazed at how they could make such astonishing worlds that were created out of thin air. In high school, I started dabbling in the world of coding. I started out by watching YouTube tutorials on how to make video games and what types of coding languages work best for creating certain things. I quickly realized that I wanted to make this my career.</p>
      <h3>Hobbies</h3>
      <p>Besides coding in my free time I also enjoy blacksmithing and working out. I find if I'm ever having troubles with a coding problem or just feel stressed about my day working out is such a great way to take an hour or two out of my day and just focus on my physical health and just clear my head of all my stresses and worries of the day. I had just recently found blacksmithing as a hobby and it has quickly become one of my favorite pastimes. It's so fun just to hit a piece of metal for hours and then feel satisfied with what you had made.</p>
