    <h2>What is Valorant:</h2>
    <p>Valorant is a tactical first-person shooter (FPS) created by Riot games. What makes Valorant different from other FPS games is that all your moves need to be thought out and calculated. Valorant rewards players for tactics and being methodical. Just one wrong move in the game and it can cost you your life. Now in a game that is so technical how can you improve? Here are a few tips and tricks that you need to know to instantly improve your overall gameplay.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>When to walk and when to run</li>
      <li>How to shoot your shots</li>
      <li>What guns work for you</li>
      <li>What type of character works for you</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>Walking or Running:</h2>
    <p>Unlike most FPS games where you can run around the map with no repercussions, Valorant discourages players from constantly running around. It makes a big difference whether you are running or walking. When you run, your character makes a bunch of noise, revealing your general location to the enemy and making it a lot easier for them to find and kill you. On the other hand, walking makes no noise whatsoever, so it's a lot easier to sneak up to the enemy and get the jump on them.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>How to shoot:</h2>
    <p>The most important thing in an FPS is being able to hit your shots. Just as whether you're running or walking determines if you make noise, it also affects your aim. If you try to shoot an enemy while running, you are most likely going to miss your shots. The best way to hit your opponent is to stay perfectly still and aim for the enemy's head. This way, your crosshair is precise enough to hit your targets. You need to practice good crosshair placement and always aim for the head. To give you a good idea about how much headshot matter here's a chart of each gun’s damages outputs.</p>

    <h2>Which gun is for you:</h2>
    <p>In Valorant you are given a wide array of guns that all have different uses and strategic values. In the first couple of matches you want to figure out what guns you feel more comfortable with, and when is it the right time to use a sniper rifle or a shotgun. Find what works for you and practice using those guns effectively.</p>
    <img src="/images/img9.webp" alt="displaying the menu of weapons in the game">
    <br>
    <h2>Which character is for you:</h2>
    <p>Valorant has an abundance of different characters with different abilities and play styles. There are four different types of classes that you can play:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Duelists - The most aggressive type. Their abilities revolve around maneuverability and blinding the enemy team</li>
      <li>Initiators - Gather intel about the enemy's positioning and provide that to their team before entering an area </li>
      <li>Controllers - The support class. They either heal their team or provide cover from the enemy</li>
      <li>Sentinels - Abilities revolve around locking down an area from incoming enemies </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Once you discover a specific playstyle, Valorant is all about personal preference. When you find what guns work well with your favorite type of character and how you can help your team win scrimmages or defend points, you’ll become a better and stronger overall Valorant player.</p>
