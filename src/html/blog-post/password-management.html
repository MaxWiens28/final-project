    <h1>Password Management</h1>
    <p>In this day and age, our lives revolve around our devices and technology. We use them every day. To pay for our groceries, order stuff off Amazon, read the news, and watch videos. We spend most of our time looking at screens.  Even though we have such a powerful device in our hands we often forget how dangerous it is. You often hear about other people getting their computers hacked, and all their information being leaked. Do we think to ourselves - that's never going to happen to me. Why would someone want my personal information? Well, you’d be surprised. If a hacker gets even a tiny piece of your personal information,  you would be amazed by all the things that they can do to change your identity. For example, they get ahold of one of your passwords or your phone number and they could easily log in to almost any of your social media accounts and kick you out of them. Now with that tiny piece of information, they have access to a majority of all your personal information,  your contacts, where you live, and much more. That's scary. </p>

    <p>Now you’re probably thinking to yourself, how could I stop this from happening to me? Well, there are a few ways that you could prevent someone from hacking into your accounts. The first step is to purchase a firewall application. What will this do for you? A firewall will filter all the information that is coming from the internet to your computer and block all the malware and bugs that are trying to seep into your computer.  Secondly, would be a password manager. A password manager is a secure piece of software that will store all your valuable passwords in a secure location and you'll have easy access to all those passwords to log in to websites. With us being on the internet so often, we are constantly needing to think of new passwords. Most of the time we just use the same password for multiple websites. This is one of the easiest ways for a hacker to take over your computer. Thirdly, keep yourself safe. A good rule of thumb is just to be smart about what websites you are using, read thoroughly what you’re accepting- if you think it is a scam, it probably is, and not share your passwords with others.</p>

    <p>As technology gets better, so do hackers. Information hacking is becoming more and more common every day. As we all rely on using the internet for many things during our everyday routine, we may get a little lazy and forget to do the smaller things, like changing our passwords or being careless. It is then that hackers move in and can change our personal life forever. Be aware, be safe, and be smart.</p>
