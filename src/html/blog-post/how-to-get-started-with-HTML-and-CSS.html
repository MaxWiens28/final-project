    <h1>How to get started with HTML and CSS</h1>
    <br>
    <h2>What are HTML and CSS</h2>
    <p>Hypertext markup language (HTML) and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are the basis for all websites. What exactly are HTML and CSS? HTML is used to create the foundation of every single website ever made. It describes how a document should be displayed in a browser using tags, elements, attributes, and more. When the structure of your website is built it needs to look appealing to the website users. Now CSS, a styling sheet language is used to describe how the HTML document appears on a web browser. To make your website look stylish, you need to use CSS rules, selectors, and values.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>HTML Basics</h2>
    <p><b>HTML elements:</b> are the structural components that tell HTML how to format the documentation. Hereâ€™s an example of an element:</p>
    <br>

    <br>
    <p><b>HTML tags:</b> are used as descriptors to tell text how it should be displayed in the documentation on a website. For example, this is what a paragraph is written as in HTML <p>This is a paragraph</p>. Practically every tag in HTML has an opening tag and a closing tag. The opening tag has an opening and closing bracket incasing the name of the element it is displaying. Closing tags are almost identical, the only difference is a forward slash in front of the element name.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>HTML Attributes:</b> are put inside the opening tag to add additional information to an element to also give it characteristics. Attributes always have a name and value to them.</p>
    <br>

    <br>
    <p><b>HTML Inline and Block Elements:</b> There are two default values that every element can either have inline, or block. </p>
    <br>
    <p><b>Inline elements:</b> only take up space that they need and stay on their preexisting line.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>Block elements:</b> start on a new line and are given extra spacing taking up the entire line.</p>
    <br>

    <br>
    <h2>CSS Basics</h2>
    <br>
    <p><b>CSS Rules:</b> groups one or more HTML elements so they can be styled. </p>
    <br>
    <p><b>Selectors:</b> are the HTML element that the styles that will be applied.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>Property:</b> a specific style type that is added to the selector.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>Values:</b> changes the selector using the set property.</p>
